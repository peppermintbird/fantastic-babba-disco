## Handling time series data with SNN architecture

While there might not be much existing research on using SNNs for handling astronomical data, here I share a prototype of a model based on Kaggle and snnTorch tutorials I've researched. 

> For enternaiment purposes, I call it NABS - Neural Astro-Biosignature Scanner, inspired by the how many times Mr. Spock says, _“The scanner can’t identify any life forms, captain.”_
